Funny enough, I still have the same problem as I did with writing on paper; I'm not very good about it.

Continuing from the previous post, I returned home on the night of 7/18 -> 7/19. The trip from Montreal was a bit wild. I was really fortunate to even have gotten home that night. From YUL, planes bound for NYC were held back due to upcoming bad weather at the destination. Fortunately they put me on another route with only a few minutes to spare to board that flight. The trip back to DFW, which I'm very familiar with at this point, was pretty smooth. However, for some very dumb reason like overloading the departure gate with 3 planes created chaos and they struggled to get anything done. Delays went from 15 minutes, to 30, to 1 hour, to 2 etc. It was very clear to me that some bullshit was gonna happen. The gate attendants, one was really nice, the other a total know-it-all asshole, instructed us to go to the concierge or whatever to get flight reassignments. So I walked the distant gate where that was and saw the humongous line. Instead of playing by the rules, I walked on over to another gate which had another flight to Seattle leaving sooner than my original one. I asked the attendant if I could be reassigned on there, and they were super helpful. Turns out I filled it the last available seat.

Later I learned that my original flight had been cancelled. :v
