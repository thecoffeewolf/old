	I've finally sat my butt down to do some writing. How I got here, or when I got here, or where here is... There's a lot to go through. I used to be a lot more organized with my thoughts back in high school. Less interesting things to do with my time, more motivation to write and reflect. Then I got into college, a statistical fortune. I stopped writing as much. The writing I did then was really bitter I think. I'd gone through a lot of emotional heartache those years. But I had an extremely enjoyable time outside of my love life. And then my 4th and 5th year happened. We'll be talking about that quite a bit in passing. Right now, I'm just going to get a handle on the current situation and answer these questions I've left.
